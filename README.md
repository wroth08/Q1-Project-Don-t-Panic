# Don't Panic

## Quarter One Project by Weston Roth

Don't Panic is a simple web app that uses NASA's NEO (Near Earth Objects) API to pull information about near earth objects (usually asteroids) and display information about them.

At the top of the page, it will display the total amount of asteroids on any given date, and how many of them are classified by NASA as "potentially hazardous" or not.

At the bottom of the page is an expandable list of all of the asteroids that were found. A header giving the name of the asteroid can be clicked on to expand for more information, including the asteroid's diameter, speed, and how close it came to hitting the Earth.

The "PANIC" and "CALM" buttons do some fun things! Try them out!
(But be careful with the panic button, make sure your volume settings are at a reasonable level)

## Changing the date

If you want to look at a different date, please note that the date entered must be in the exact format YYYY-MM-DD.

## Technologies Used

- Materialize: Heavily edited, mostly used for the collapsible list javascript as well as the CSS grid system.

- Moment.js library: To get the current date more easily.

- Sass: To make my life easier.

- jQuery: Again, to make my life not awful for making the dynamically rendered site.
